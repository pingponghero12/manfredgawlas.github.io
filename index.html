        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm a student at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. I study Algorithmic Computer Science and Aeronautics and Astronautics. My main fields of interest are external 
        CFD simulations and writing simulators for physics, mainly theromodynamics and fluid mechanics.</p>
        <p>Im also a member of PWR in Space student organisation, which concerns itself with design and making of rockets. There I worked on projects concerning simulation of
        rocket engines and their construction, as well as external CFD simulations of rockets.</p>

            <h2>CFD simulaions for Attitude Control System</h2>
            <h3>Currently working on it.</h3>
            <p>I'm currently working in ANSYS to conduct parametric study of forces and torques acting on rocket depending on angles of attack and side slip, as well as independent angles
            of control surfaces. The goal is to find aerodynamic coefficients for rocket which we could insert into our control algorithm.</p>
            <p>For this project I'm using ANSYS Fluent to conduct simulations. I'm also using Solidworks to prepare geometries for simulations.</p>
            <p>We already made several partial studies using Solidworks Fluid Simulations, however we couldn't access a computer strong enough to conduct full study.</p>

        <h2>Drag Coefficient Study</h2>
        <p>I conducted a study of drag coefficient as a function of Mach number for a rocket model that I created based on PWR is Space's R5 rocket. Results were compared
        with experimental data from Modern Exterior Ballistics and with results from other simulations. The goal was to find out how accurate are the results of simulations 
        were and to find graph for this rocket's drag coefficient.</p>

        <h2>Water Rocket Simulator</h2>
        <p>This application simulates simple rocket engine, consisting of chamber with pressurized gas and liquid. Rocket thrust is generated through expulsion of either liquid 
            or gas, caused by the expansion of gas. Users have the flexibility to select from a list of predefined gases or introduce custom ones.</p>
            
        <p>Beyond individual simulations, the program offers a feature allowing users to visualize plots depicting output values against varying input parameters.</p>

        <h2>RMS2</h2>
        <p>
            RSM2 is a simulator of a stable fuel rocket engines for BATES geometries. The program allows users to get graphs of pressure, thrust as well as values of impulse and time of burning.
        </p>
            
        <p> Program is writen in python with usage of matplotlib.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Engine Regression</h2>
            <h3>Currently working on it.</h3>
            <p> I'm currently working on a project concerning regression of hybrid rocket engine. The goal is create a tool that determines regression coefficients of fuel,
                based on geometries and thrust curves which are experimentaly determined.</p>
            
            <p> For this project first goal is to create a hybrid rocket engine simulator. The program is being written in C++.</p>
