            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a student at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology, where I study Algorithmic Computer Science and Aeronautics and Astronautics.</p>
            <p>Beyond that, I'm a member of the PWR in Space student organization, focusing on designing and building rockets. My work primarily involves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Performing CFD simulations in Ansys Fluent and SolidWorks for the R6 rocket and ACS project.</li>
                <li>Programming simulators for rocket engines.</li>
                <li>Data analisys using Python.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One of my strengths is the ability to prepare thorough and accurate technical documentation.</p>

            <h2>CFD simulaions for Attitude Control System</h2>
            <h3>Curently researching optimal domain and mesh for 4 parameter study of Sternik 1.5 rocket.</h3>
            <p>I'm currently working in ANSYS to conduct parametric study of forces and torques acting on rocket depending on angles of attack and side slip, as well as independent angles
            of control surfaces. The goal is to find aerodynamic coefficients for rocket which we could insert into our control algorithm.</p>
            <p>For this project I'm using ANSYS Fluent to conduct simulations. I'm also using Solidworks and Ansys SpaceClaim to prepare geometries for simulations.</p>
            <p>We already made several partial studies using Solidworks Fluid Simulations and Ansys Fluent, now we are waiting for full Ansys licence to preform full study on computing cluster.</p>

            <h2>Technical report for R6</h2>
            <h3>Currently working on adding results of Ansys Fluent simulations.</h3>
            <p>This is edited version of Aerodynamics appenix from Technical Report for SPACEPORT AMERICA CUP 2024. It is a part of our Aerodynamics repository on GitHub, on which we try to keep
            all documentation concerning aerodynamics of our rockets. The content of it is mostly my work.</p>

        <h2>Drag Coefficient Study</h2>
        <p>I conducted a study of drag coefficient as a function of Mach number for a rocket model that I created based on PWR is Space's R5 rocket. Results were compared
        with experimental data from Modern Exterior Ballistics and with results from other simulations. The goal was to find out how accurate are the results of simulations 
        were and to find graph for this rocket's drag coefficient.</p>

        <h2>Water Rocket Simulator</h2>
        <h3>I'm working on rewriting it, so it meets standards of OOP.</h3>
        <p>This application simulates simple rocket engine, consisting of chamber with pressurized gas and liquid. Rocket thrust is generated through expulsion of either liquid 
            or gas, caused by the expansion of gas. Users have the flexibility to select from a list of predefined gases or introduce custom ones.</p>
            
        <p>Beyond individual simulations, the program offers a feature allowing users to visualize plots depicting output values against varying input parameters.</p>

        <h2>RMS2</h2>
        <p>
            RSM2 is a simulator of a stable fuel rocket engines for BATES geometries. The program allows users to get graphs of pressure, thrust as well as values of impulse and time of burning.
        </p>
            
        <p> Program is writen in python with usage of matplotlib.</p>

            <h2>Analisys of Hybrid Rocket Engine Solvers</h2>
            <h3>Currently working on it.</h3>
            <p> I'm in early process of creating a tool for simulation of Hybrid Rocket Engines, that will be able to preform various analisys on simulation results and will include different solvers to compare
            them with each other. The goal is to find out which solver is the most accurate and to find out how to improve them.</p>
            </p>
            
            <p>Program is being writen in both Python and Java.</p>
